            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And it may be al≈øo that ≈øome among the Catholiques will be ready to ≈øay this is but the opinion meerely of ≈øome one particular Per≈øon, and that all Prote≈øtants will not ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribe unto it. But I prote≈øt before God, that I never heard of any knowing judicious man with us, who≈øe di≈øcour≈øe agrees not with that of the Author here; and it were to be wi≈øhed that the whole world would conforme it ≈øelfe to the example of the <hi>Reformed</hi> in <hi>France.</hi> Were it ≈øo, there ≈øhould no Prince ≈øtand in need of guards, or be forced to levy Armies for the defence of his Per≈øon again≈øt the in≈øolence and Rebellion of Subjects. There would be no more undermining the peace of the Church, which would now cheri≈øh a compleat union &amp; ab≈øolute corre≈øpondency betwixt its owne and the ≈øecular government, confining it ≈øelfe to its proper limits, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ≈øtill a ≈øpeciall regard to that ≈øubordination which is required of it. I ≈øpeake this, Reader, becau≈øe it is true; though ≈øundry conceive otherwi≈øe of it, either meerely out of a cu≈øtome they have embraced wholly to ≈øurrender them≈øelves unto the ≈øway of other mens judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: or becau≈øe they have a ≈øtrong prejudice again≈øt the Di≈øcipline we practice, as if it were not altogether ≈øo agreeable with Monarchy.

<pb facs="tcp:113221:4"/> and thou can≈øt not but conclude, that the ≈øole drift of our intentions hath ever beene to defend our ≈øelves rather by the weapons of the Spirit, then tho≈øe of the fle≈øh, and that we joine in an unanimous dete≈øtation of all ≈øuch as maintaine it lawfull to make u≈øe of temporall violence for promoting the truth of the Go≈øpell. This Letter I here pre≈øent thee with, is ca≈øt in the mould of the true Prote≈øtants. It appeares in defence of their doctrine touching the power of Kings, and the obedience of Subjects; withall condemning their proceedings, who under a pretence of purging the Church from its errours and enormities, and rein≈øtating Chri≈øtians in their lo≈øt Liberty, maske a de≈øigne of engaging the whole world in a horrible confu≈øion. I cannot informe thee, who is the author of it.

He hath done it, thou ≈øee≈øt. He paints them in their proper colours, points out the contrivers of them, and their aimes. He makes it legible to the world, that this Parliament is nothing, in generality, but a ≈øeditious Crew, bending all their indeavours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt the Lawes of the Realme, with a de≈øigne to turne all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Could any the mo≈øt active and noted adver≈øaries of Epi≈øcopacy ever blemi≈øh the conver≈øation of Doctor <hi>Bromhall</hi> Bi≈øhop of <hi>Derry,</hi> of <hi>Jewell, Bil≈øon, Hall, Downham, Davenant, Sands, Abbot, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drewes, <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øher, Prideaux,</hi> and a large Catalogue be≈øides of ≈øuch who≈øe vertues are not yet come to my knowledge, no more then their names? For all tho≈øe prerogatives they enjoy above other men by rea≈øon of the Character they beare, for all that ≈øuperiority and tho≈øe titles full of pompe and magnificence the Lawes of the Land have allowed them; did ever any know them give the lea≈øt ≈øcandall to the mo≈øt ≈øcrupulous con≈øcience, or the lea≈øt occa≈øion for the meane≈øt Subject to complaine of them?

And if the name they beare ≈øpeakes them engaged to a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall taske in managing of publicke affaires, have they not ever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied all the powers of their ≈øoules to the pur≈øuance of the ≈øame?

            <p>This may be true of ≈øome, but is a gro≈ø≈øe ≈ølander upon the mo≈øt of them.</p>

Their examples, their conver≈øation, their affable deportment might happily one day draw them over to a Profe≈ø≈øion from which bani≈øhments and other the like rigorous cour≈øes doe commonly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert them. Religion cannot be forced upon the ≈øoule. God mu≈øt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Infu≈øe it him≈øelfe, or per≈øwade it by men.

            <p>But the ca≈øe was much otherwi≈øe, ≈øo as never were any in a more deplorable condition, then they.

And if they had not been Prote≈øtants indeed, would they not have gone over to the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, and have followed the prevailing party? was there for all this, I will not ≈øay a Bi≈øhop, but even any well affected to Epi≈øcopacy, whom the threats of Fire and Sword could prevaile with to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace Popery, and renounce the Reformed Religion?</p>
            <p>They further tell us, that they doated too much upon titles of pride and ambition, and ≈øuch honours as the ≈øuper≈øtition and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of blinder times be≈øtowed on them. Be≈øhrew their hearts that did ≈øo. But the Innocent have rea≈øon to complaine of hard dealing, if they mu≈øt be li≈øted with the guilty, were there indeed any ≈øuch at all. You will pardon me if I ≈øhall hereupon avouch, that many even of our owne men have ≈øometimes picked a quarrell where there needed none. I remember we once fell in di≈øcour≈øe upon this argument, and how after ≈øome ≈ølight debate you agreed with me in the up≈øhot, that the Over≈øeers of the Church ought in all rea≈øon to be inve≈øted with ≈øome di≈øtinct and peculiar character to draw re≈øpect from inferiours; That this was ever the practice of the Church, and the very intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of tho≈øe that e≈øtabli≈øhed a ≈øuperiority therein. Whence aro≈øe the ≈øeverall appellations of <hi>Father, Paternity, Pope, Holine≈ø≈øe,</hi> with many ≈øuch in u≈øe with antiquity. Nor is <hi>Epi≈øcopacy</hi> and the <hi>respects</hi> due unto it commended unto us with more earne≈øtne≈ø≈øe, then former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they were. As God ≈øeemes to have graven his image in a more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent manner upon the face of ≈øuch as are in authority, thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øenting his unity, (an unity not to be parallell'd with any thing in the world) in like ≈øort hath the Church univer≈øall honoured them with ≈øuch prerogatives as might be≈øt denote the obedience due to God him≈øelfe who conferred that function upon them.
